# Agentic Hedge Fund System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Agentic Hedge Fund system architecture, explaining how the different components interact to form a complete trading system.

## System Components

The system is composed of the following key components, organized in layers:

1. **Trading Agents Layer**
   - Specialized trading agents that implement different trading strategies
   - Each agent analyzes market data and generates trading signals

2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Layer**
   - Manages context and coordinates tool calls across agents
   - Provides a centralized context for agents to share information
   - Handles communication between trading agents

3. **Risk Manager Layer**
   - Assesses and adjusts trading signals based on risk metrics
   - Aggregates multiple signals into a consensus signal
   - Implements risk controls to protect the portfolio

4. **Portfolio Manager Layer**
   - Manages the portfolio of assets
   - Tracks positions, cash, and transaction history
   - Calculates portfolio metrics and performance

5. **Actions Layer (Order Execution)**
   - Handles the execution of trades through broker APIs
   - Manages order lifecycle (submission, execution, cancellation)

6. **Data Providers Layer**
   - Retrieves market data from external sources
   - Provides real-time and historical price data
   - Provides fundamental data, news sentiment, etc.

7. **Frontend Layer**
   - Displays real-time portfolio and performance data
   - Visualizes trading signals and decisions
   - Shows transaction history and position information

8. **Simulation Layer**
   - Provides backtesting capabilities using historical data
   - Allows testing strategies without real market execution
   - Calculates performance metrics for strategies

## Data Flow

Here's how data flows through the system:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The Data Providers layer fetches market data from external sources
   - Data includes price information, fundamentals, news sentiment, etc.
   - This data is organized and prepared for analysis

2. **Signal Generation**:
   - Trading Agents analyze the market data
   - Each agent applies its specific strategy (value, technical, sentiment, etc.)
   - Agents generate trading signals with confidence scores

3. **Signal Coordination**:
   - The Model Context Protocol (MCP) coordinates context and tool usage
   - Enables communication between different agent types
   - Maintains a shared context for all agents

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The Risk Manager evaluates signals against risk thresholds
   - Adjusts signal confidence based on current market risks
   - Aggregates multiple signals into a single consensus

5. **Portfolio Decision**:
   - The Portfolio Manager evaluates the consensus signal
   - Determines appropriate position sizing
   - Checks portfolio constraints and cash availability

6. **Order Execution**:
   - The Actions Layer executes the trading decision
   - Converts portfolio decisions into market orders
   - Monitors order status and execution

7. **Monitoring and Visualization**:
   - The Frontend Layer displays the current state of the system
   - Shows portfolio performance, trades, and signals
   - Provides dashboards for monitoring system health
